# Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob and Flask

**Sentiment Analysis** is a crucial component of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on user reviews using the TextBlob NLP library and build a Flask-based web application.

## What is Sentiment Analysis?

**Sentiment Analysis** is a technique that involves determining the sentiment, whether **positive, negative, or neutral**, expressed in a piece of text. It has wide-ranging applications, from gauging public opinion on social media to assessing customer feedback for businesses.

## What You'll Learn

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Gain a solid understanding of sentiment analysis, its applications, and its significance in the realm of NLP and Machine Learning.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Explore the fascinating world of NLP, where computers are trained to understand and analyze human language.

- **TextBlob**: Learn how to use **TextBlob**, a Python library that simplifies NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis.

- **Building Web Applications with Flask**: Create a fully functional web application from scratch using **Flask**, a versatile Python web framework.
